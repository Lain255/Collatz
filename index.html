    <h1>The Collatz Conjecture</h1>
    <p>
        The Collatz Conjecture is a simple statement that is hard to prove. Given the funtion
    </p>
    <div class="math">
        f(x) = 3x+1 if x is odd, otherwise x/2
    </div>
    <p>
        In other words, given any seed value x, does iterating f eventually give 1?
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are some examples. We create sequences by taking a<sub>1</sub> to equal x, the starting value.
        We then use the rule a<sub>n</sub> = f(a<sub>n-1</sub>)
        <ul>
            <li>1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1. This demonstrates that 1 is a loop.</li>
            <li>2 -> 1. Powers of 2 simplify easy</li>
            <li>3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1. Longest string so far is 1 below a power of 2</li>
            <li>4 -> 2 -> 1. Powers of 2 simplify easy</li>
            <li>5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1. This sequence is a subsequence of 3s expansion</li>
        </ul>
        If you continue these expansions you may notice a few things.
        <ul>
            <li>All the numbers have given 1 eventually (If you found a number that doesnt, you just solved the collatz conjecture)</li>
            <li>There is alot of repetition. for example, 5s sequence is a subsequence of 3s sequence</li>
        </ul>
        To solve the repetition problem let -> be transitive. ei, if a -> b -> c, then a -> c.
        To see this in effect lets redo the examples
        <ul>
            <li>1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1.</li>
            <li>2 -> 1. </li>
            <li>3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 1. notice that 2 is ommited since we already know 4 -> 2 -> 1</li>
            <li>4 -> 1. Powers of 2 simplify easy</li>
            <li>5 -> 1. 5s expansion is simplified alot since it is a subsequence of a previous sequence</li>
        </ul>
        -> helps abstract away the number of iterations and focuses on if a number reaches a known 1 terminating sequence.
        
    </p>
    <h2>Prime Factors, and Simple 2s</h2>
    <p>
        When first tackling the problem, abstracting away the 2s is usually the first step. 
        Since even numbers are divided by 2 until they are odd, they strip away all the 2s from a numbers prime factorization.
        For example, look at the collatz sequences of numbers broken into their prime factors
    
        <ul>
            <li>3  = 3 -> 1. </li>
            <li>6  =                     2*3 -> 3 -> 1</li>
            <li>12 =            2*2*3 -> 2*3 -> 3 -> 1</li>
            <li>24 = 2*2*2*3 -> 2*2*3 -> 2*3 -> 3 -> 1</li>
        </ul>

        Notice all the powers of two vanish and leave 3. In general x*2<sup>n</sup> -> x.
        This means x*2<sup>n</sup> forms an equivilance class that all collapse to n.
        In effect this means we ignore powers of 2, and we can now focus only on odd numbers.
        Lets look at the collatz sequences focusing on prime factorizations ignoring powers of 2.

        <ul>
            <li>3 -> 5 -> 1</li>
            <li>5 -> 1</li>
            <li>7 -> 11 -> </li>

        </ul>
